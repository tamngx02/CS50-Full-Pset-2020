Full Problem Sets in CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Course 2020

Hi people !

My name is Tam. I am currently a freshman at Aalto University in Finland. 
Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 virus that I cannot go to Finland to start my tertiary education.
So I have registered as a non-attending student and I'm having my gap year.

During this time, I decided to improve my skills in Computer Science and I signed up for the CS50 Intro to CS course on edX.

Personally, I believe that the psets in this course in really challenging. I had to do a lot of researches, read a lot, think a lot, and frustrating a lot as well lol.
Therefore, I would like to post all my solution for psets in CS50 Intro to CS 2020 here so that you guys can refer to, and maybe, can help you out with your problems.
CS50 is an amazing course and it really helps me out and improves me technically. Thanks to David, Brian, Doug Lloyd and all the CS50 staffs who have created this wonderful course.

For those who are struggling with CS50, don't give up. You can do it! Hope this can help you out with your problem !
